# Orchestra

These libraries encompass more than just one orchestral section.

Product bundles, which are composed of smaller products (usually divided into strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion) are not mentioned here, but their component products are covered in the other pages of this guide. The bundles are often more comprehensive than the orchestral packages listed here, allowing for more detailed arrangements.

Each product is relatively niche.

- Metropolis Ark 2 - Meant for an powerful but quiet sound, great for more subdued tracks. *ppp* to *mp* dynamics.
- Metropolis Ark 3 - Meant for an aggressive, rhythmic sound. Includes lots of atonal and repetition articulations, plus a huge variety of epic percussion.
- Metropolis Ark 4 - Meant for a dramatic, powerful, and focused sound. *ppp* to *fff* dynamics.

**Albion series**  
Spitfire Audio - Works with the free Kontakt Player  
*[ONE](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-one/) / [Iceni](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-iii-iceni/) / [Uist](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-iv-uist/) / [Tundra](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-tundra/) / [Neo](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-neo) each $450*

**STRENGTHS:**  
Useful and great-sounding collection of instruments including more than just orchestral instruments (most volumes contain mutated samples, loops, and percussion).

**WEAKNESSES:**  
Individual instrument sections are often unavailable - these libraries will not give you finer control over the orchestra.

**DETAILS:**
- Albion ONE - The vanilla volume, aimed toward a traditional epic sound.
- Albion III Iceni - Aimed toward a powerful, meaty, and occasionally nasty low-end sound.
- Albion IV Uist - An aleatoric volume designed to meet all of your needs for orchestral effects.
- Albion Tundra - Aimed toward the pristine, ethereal sound of an orchestra playing extremely quietly.
- Albion Neo - A volume with smaller section sizes, aimed toward a modern, intimate sound.
