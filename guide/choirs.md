*$400 / [More info](https://8dio.com/instrument/lacrimosa-epic-choir-for-kontakt-vst-au-aax/)*

**STRENGTHS:**  
A massive 200-person choir designed for maximum force. Is surprisingly adept at lower dynamics. Very lush and rich.

**WEAKNESSES:**  
The size of the choir makes it very inflexible for doing anything smaller or more intimate. It can also cause problems regarding realism when taking layering and polyphony into consideration (too large and dense).
