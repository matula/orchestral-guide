# Choirs

• Strezov Next Generation Choir series – Strezov Sampling – *Requires full Kontakt
Wotan Male Choir $330 / Freyja Female Choir $330 / Arva Children Choir $430

STRENGTHS: Incredible sound, fantastic scripting. Features and functionality are consistent across the series.

WEAKNESSES: Each volume covers just one group of choral performers so to have a fully versatile choir you will need to spend more.

• Oceania – Performance Samples – *Requires full Kontakt
$270 / More info

STUB: Incredibly playable choir meant for energetic, thematic writing.

• Olympus Symphonic Choir – Soundiron- Kontakt Player Library
Micro $30 / Elements $100 / Full $550

STUB: A very vanilla choir library, includes everything you would expect a choral VST to include (though boys’ choir is a separate package).

• Lacrimosa Epic Choir – 8Dio – *Requires full Kontakt
$600 / More info

STRENGTHS: A massive 200-person choir designed for maximum force. Is surprisingly adept at lower dynamics. Very lush and rich.

WEAKNESSES: The size of the choir makes it very inflexible for doing anything smaller or more intimate. It can also cause problems regarding realism when taking layering and polyphony into consideration (too large and dense).

• VOXOS Epic Choirs – Cinesamples – Kontakt Player Library
$500 / More info

STUB: A solid basic choral package.

• Mercury Symphonic Boychoir – Soundiron – *Requires full Kontakt
Elements $100 / Full $400

STUB: A comprehensive boys’ choir.

• Storm Choir 2 – Strezov Sampling – *Requires full Kontakt
Core $330 / Exp $190 / Bundle $470

STRENGTHS: Great tone and scripting, captures a wide dynamic range.

WEAKNESSES: The “slavonic molto vibrato tone” makes this library less versatile than other general-purpose choirs.
