(EastWest products are often on sale)

STRENGTHS: Great sound, playability, and value for your money. This library set the standard for modern brass sampling.

WEAKNESSES: It has a few bugs and inconsistencies throughout, and is quite the resource hog. If you want to use it without inconvenience, use an SSD.

DETAILS: If you are considering this library and looking for a full orchestral package, Hollywood Orchestra is an incredible-value collection including Hollywood Strings, Hollywood Brass, Hollywood Orchestral Woodwinds, and Hollywood Orchestral Percussion.

• Adventure Brass – Musical Sampling – *Requires full Kontakt
$300 / More info

STRENGTHS: A great-sounding collection with amazing agility and playability. Can craft very believable performances. Perfectly suited to orchestral adventure music, as the title suggests.

WEAKNESSES: The library is somewhat niche and not very comprehensive in terms of articulations and instrumentation.
