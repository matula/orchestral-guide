# Glossary

**Sample player** – Sample players are the engines that run your libraries. Every library requires a sample player to be run,  but you don’t need to understand how they work. Each library in this guide will indicate whether it requires a sample player to be purchased in order to use the library. If a library says "Requires sample player purchase (Kontakt)", you will have to buy the full version of Kontakt from Native Instruments in order to use it. If it doesn't say that, the library likely runs in a free player like SINE, PLAY, or the Kontakt Player (the free version of Kontakt).

**Wet/Dry** – A wet library is one that was recorded with the ambience of the hall baked into the samples. Dry libraries have very little ambience in the samples. Wet libraries typically have the advantage of sounding marvelous straight out of the box, and offer a sense of realism since they sound just as they sounded in a real room/hall. Dry libraries have the advantage of being much easier to blend in with other libraries and being much more versatile and flexible – however, you will need a reverb plugin to use these to their full potential.

**SSD** – Solid State Drive, a type of hard drive that transfers data faster than “normal” hard drives and thus results in quicker load times for samples stored there. Will require at least a USB 3.0 connection for improved speeds.

**RR** – Round Robin, a technique that involves multiple recordings of the same note and technique. For example, a cello with 8x RR spiccato means that each spiccato note was sampled 8 times, and so when you play a note multiple times, it does not play the same sample over and over. This sampling technique enhances realism.
