## What is this guide?

Hi everyone,

Looking back to when I was just starting out with virtual instruments, I realize that it took me a very long time to piece together anything about VSTs. This guide is meant to be a resource for people who want to learn more about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the most bread-and-butter and/or popular orchestral sample libraries. This guide is not meant to be the ultimate orchestral VST shopping list, just an introduction to some of a composer’s best options.

I’ll do my best to keep this up to date as new libraries are released. If you have any questions, comments, or input, please post in [this associated forum thread](https://vi-control.net/community/threads/buyers-basic-guide-to-orchestral-sample-libraries.49450/) over at VI-Control. If you are overwhelmed with the information in this guide, I would recommend creating a thread on that forum that asks your question and/or explains your situation. There are lots of people there willing to help you out – just keep in mind that the community can be biased toward specific developers, so don’t take anyone’s word as gospel.

A word to the wise: In the end you’re the one spending your hard-earned money, so it’s you who has to be happy with your purchase. I may claim that a library is essential, beloved, and great value for your money, but you should still be watching the walkthroughs and judging for yourself. If you don’t like what you’re hearing, don’t buy it.

It’s unrealistic for me to own and have extensive experience with every single one of these libraries. This guide is meant to introduce you to the best options out there so that you can do some more research on the products that interest you and make a final decision for yourself.

## Terminology

**Kontakt/PLAY** – Kontakt is used as a sample player – you need it to use some libraries (which are scripted to be able to run in Kontakt). You don’t need to understand how it works though. Just know that if a library listed below says “*Requires full Kontakt” then you will have to buy the full version of Kontakt from Native Instruments to use it – if it doesn’t say that, then the library likely runs in a free player like EastWest’s PLAY engine or the Kontakt Player, which is the free version of Kontakt.

**Wet/Dry** – A wet library is one that was recorded with the ambience of the hall baked into the samples. Dry libraries have very little ambience in the samples. Wet libraries typically have the advantage of sounding marvelous straight out of the box, and offer a sense of realism since they sound just as they sounded in a real room/hall. Dry libraries have the advantage of being much easier to blend in with other libraries and being much more versatile and flexible – however, you will need a reverb plugin to use these to their full potential.

**SSD** – Solid State Drive, a type of hard drive that transfers data faster than “normal” hard drives and thus results in quicker load times for samples stored there. Will require at least a USB 3.0 connection for improved speeds.

**RR** – Round Robin, a technique that involves multiple recordings of the same note and technique. For example, a cello with 8x RR spiccato means that each spiccato note was sampled 8 times, and so when you play a note multiple times, it does not play the same sample over and over. This sampling technique enhances realism.
